+quarto allows us to write beautiful texts 
about +pyth or similar complicated formulas (e.g. +forml), 
and to [create our *own* filter extensions](+qurl/extensions/filters.html). +br
Even extensions that replace text:+br
.doo+dab+dab!dua, +dab!dua!

Since we wanted to +wedo, we chose to render as +form.
